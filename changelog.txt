Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 3.0
Major changes
- MMR Mystery Maker is now available as a standalone executable! No Python or command line required!
- Chest Fairies, except for STT's Death Armos and Updraft Fire Ring (the two STT "flip fairies"),
  are now shuffled in all seeds.  Clock Town Stray Fairy is shuffled in all seeds.
  The remaining stray fairies (including Death Armos and Updraft Fire Ring) will still appear in some seeds.
- Fierce Deity's Mask Anywhere returns to Mystery as a special category. It's always active if FD is selected
  as the random starting item; otherwise, it's active 45% of the time. 
  When active, FD Anywhere and some FD Anywhere-specific tricks will be in logic!
- Just like Small Key Mode, Boss Key Mode is now Doors Open by default. Boss Key chests are always shuffled.
  If Keysanity: Boss Keys is active, Boss Keys will appear and the doors will be locked.
  (In Fairy Hunt seeds, Keysanity: Boss Keys is still never active. Doors Open will always be in effect there.) 
- Beyond that, both Keysanity categories have been changed significantly: options for both Boss Keys and
  Small Keys are now "Doors Open", "Shuffle Within Their Temple", and "Shuffle Within Any Temple". Boss Keys
  Within Any Temple is counted as a hard option.
  Warning: when Boss Keys and Small Keys appear, they are not considered by WotH or foolish hints! A foolish
  temple can still contain required keys! This is how MMR handles the Keep Within Temples mode for keys.
- Only 2 foolish hints are now given (formerly 3). The limit for WotHs, foolishes, and always hints (aka Tier 1
  hints) on gossips has been lowered to 12, ensuring that at least two Tier 2 hints will appear on gossips in
  every seed. See below for details.
- To mitigate Mystery's complexity for new learners and improve the relevance of temples, certain other 
  categories, weights, and settings have been changed. See below for details.

Script changes
- MMR Mystery Maker is now packaged as a standalone executable. Users can download and run Mystery Maker
  alongside their MMR install without needing a Python installation or command line experience.
  Placing MysteryMaker.exe in the same directory as your MMR install is recommended for ease of use.
  For interested parties, the source script remains available in the project GitHub along with instructions for
  creating the .exe yourself using PyInstaller (https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/index.html).
- A GUI now appears when Mystery Maker is run without any command-line options. The GUI allows users to browse
  to their desired settings file and MMR.CLI.exe, specify options, and generate seeds.
  GUI-less operation is still available: adding any command line argument will bypass the GUI and begin
  generating right away using the specified options and unchanged defaults.
- Added an option ("-r" on the command line) to specify an MMR.CLI.exe in any location. This allows the
  MysteryMaker.exe to be kept in a different directory: when run this way, all output (including MMR's output!)
  will be placed in an "output" directory inside Mystery Maker's current directory. 

Category and settings changes
- Dungeon maps and compasses are no longer shuffled (they're back to being starting items).
  Info on temple and boss locations can no longer be obtained from them.
  The new "Map Reveals Location" and "Compass Reveals Boss" toggles in MMR 1.16 often allowed for players to
  nearly or even completely deduce all location shuffles before even entering a temple, making location shuffles
  significantly less interesting. 
- Seeds reaching the hard option limit no longer grant a bonus starting remains.
  This effect made Frog Choir + Frogs (and the new Boss Keys Within Any Temple) likely to junk or diminish
  themselves by being selected. Starting Boss Remains was tweaked to compensate.
- The Starting Boss Remains category is more likely to grant two starting boss remains (5% -> 10%).
  Starting with one remains stays at 25%.
  Due to the hard option limit bonus, the probability of Mystery 2.x seeds giving two remains
  was actually about 8%.  With the bonus gone in 3.0, this change helps preserve the opportunity for
  players to experience a blitz-2 seed. 
- Seeds now always grant a free starting item. The Bunny Hood and Adult's Wallet are now starting item options;
  Magic is removed as a starting item option.
  FD Anywhere is always enabled if the Fierce Deity's Mask is a starting item (see below).
  * Deku Mask: 9% -> 10% 
  * Goron Mask: 9% -> 10%
  * Zora Mask: 9% -> 10%
  * Fierce Deity's Mask: 3% -> 10%
  * Bow: 4% -> 10%
  * Hookshot: 4% -> 10%
  * Wallet: 0% -> 10%
  * Empty Bottle (Dampe's): 0% -> 10%
  * Great Fairy's Sword: 3% -> 5%
  * Bunny Hood: 0% -> 5%
  * Bomb Bag and Blast Mask stay at 5% each.
  * Magic is removed (4% -> 0%).
  Guaranteeing a starting random item and expanding the item pool helps add variety to seeds and
  encourages novel lines of play in the early game.
- Added a new category: Fierce Deity's Mask Anywhere. Options are "no change" (55%) and "on" (45%).
  When active, FD Anywhere is enabled. Use of FD is in logic for certain checks!
  FD Anywhere doesn't add or change any checks. Like the starting categories, it won't count toward the
  minimum category limit. This is only rolled when FD isn't granted by Starting Random Item (FD Anywhere will
  always be on if you start with it).
  Returning from Mystery 1.15, FD Anywhere is an exciting option that allows players to traverse Termina in
  new and interesting ways, which makes it a perfect candidate for Mystery.
- New FD-specific tricks for easier FD jumps and jump slashes have been enabled in all base settings files:
  * Skull Kid With FD
  * Straw Roof as FD
  * Big Octo Skip as FD
  * Powder Keg Challenge Access as FD
  * Path to Snowhead as FD
  * Path to Snowhead Pillar as FD
  * Climb Stone Tower as FD
  All of these will only affect logic when FD Anywhere is on and FD is accessible in the seed.
- All seeds now grant a free starting song (beyond Time and Soaring). Starting Random Song weights are now:
  No extra song: 40% -> 0% 
  Epona's Song: 25% -> 40%
  Any other song except for Oath to Order: 35% -> 60%
  Swamp Music Statue is now always junked, regardless of Songsanity.
  Guaranteeing a starting song removes a Songsanity-related conditional change. Additionally, Oath to Order
  offers no positive value at the start of a seed; excluding it means that the Oath hint won't be immediately
  invalidated and allows the remaining songs to be weighted neatly at 10 each.
- Many conditional changes, mostly to weights (e.g. blitz making entrance shuffles more likely), are
  removed. Some of the removed weight increases are partially applied to the base weights.
  * Starting Random Song is no longer affected by Songsanity. See above for more on Starting Random Song.
  * Scoopsanity is no longer affected by Soilsanity--Bottle: Bug is never shuffled regardless.
  * Entrances: Temples is no longer more likely with blitz. Increased base weight (30% or 60% -> 45%).
  * Entrances: Boss Rooms is no longer more likely with blitz. Increased base weight (25% or 50% -> 30%).
  * Long Quests is no longer affected by Songsanity. See below for more on Long Quests.
  * Frogs is no longer more likely with the Frog Choir option. Increased base weight (25% or 50% -> 35%).
  Note that Shopsanity: Checks being active will still make Shopsanity: Prices more likely to be active. 
  Frogs + Frog Choir is still a hard option.
  Every extra conditional change adds more for new Mystery runners to learn and for experienced Mystery
  runners to remember. While conditional changes aren't without merit (indeed, a couple are added in 3.0!)
  their added complexity means that using them sparingly is ideal.
- Chest Fairies, except for STT's Death Armos and Updraft Fire Ring, are shuffled in all seeds.
  Death Armos and Updraft Fire Ring can still be added by All Stray Fairies, which is now more likely to
  be active (10% -> 30%).
  When All Stray Fairies is selected, both Death Armos and Updraft Fire Ring are sometimes hints.
  This change addresses both previous versions' tendency for overworld-heavy seeds and the recent interest in
  more dungeon play in standard-style seeds. The "flip fairies" are marked outliers in terms of effort required,
  so they're removed from guaranteed appearance and may be hinted when they do appear.
  Existing precedent set by Blitz and Scrubs should make the exclusion easier to remember.  
- Both Keysanity: Boss Keys and Keysanity: Small Keys are reworked. Both Boss Keys and Small Keys use the 
  options and weights below, but are each rolled separately:
  * Doors Open: 50% for Boss Keys, 60% for Small Keys
  * Shuffled Within Their Temple ("Keep Within Temples" + "Keep Within Area"): 30% Boss, 20% Small
  * Shuffled Within Any Temple ("Keep Within Temples"): 20% Boss (hard option!), 20% Small
  Even if required, Boss Keys and Small Keys can be in temples hinted foolish! Keys will also never be
  hinted WotH.
  In Fairy Hunt seeds, Boss Keys are still always off.
  This change is intended to promote more temple play as well as slightly relieve pressure on hint capacity
  (as Boss Keys can no longer add a WotH). Boss Keys Shuffled Within Any Temple very often results in more
  dungeon dipping, so it is designated as a hard option in recognition of the extra time consumed.
- Hit Spots is split into two active options: One Rupee Each and All Rupees. The new One Rupee Each option
  shuffles only one rupee at each hit spot, reducing the check count from 73 to 25. All Rupees is now much
  rarer, but can still appear (70%/0%/30% -> 70%/25%/5%).
  Among categories of similar rarity, full Hit Spots had an exceptional number of checks, especially in
  Sphere 0. This change lets the category appear without heavily skewing the early game too often.
- Tokensanity is split into two active options: One House and Both Houses. The new One House option shuffles
  all tokens in only one of the spider houses, chosen at random. Both Houses is now much rarer, but can still
  appear (80%/0%/20% -> 80%/15%/5%).
  Even one Spider House has plenty of impact on a seed, and Starting Random Item is even more able to shift them
  earlier. There's no need to require both houses to appear as a pair. 
- Long Quests is reworked to remove All Long Quests and the Songsanity conditional changes.
  * No Long Quests: 50% -> 35%
  * Anju and Kafei: 15% -> 20%
  * Baby Zoras: 5% or 15% -> 15% 
  * Frog Choir: 25% or 15% -> 30% -- when Frogs is on, this is a hard option!
  Because an individual Long Quest check is still rarely required even when it's active (except for Baby Zoras
  in non-Songsanity!), All Long Quests was likely to just eat up three hint slots (or two hints + relevant Eggs)
  which doesn't make a good contribution to a seed. Frog Choir remains favored due to its interactions with
  temples and vulnerability to Blitz-junking.
- Minigames no longer has an "All Minigames" option. The single-minigame option gains that weight (15% -> 20%)
  keeping the total 20% chance of the category being active.
  As with All Long Checks, the hint capacity requirements of All Minigames make it difficult to justify.
  The new additions to the hard option list also made the removal of All Minigames attractive.
- Minigames no longer shuffles Beaver Race 2. Skip Younger Beaver is now always off.
  In testing, Skip Younger Beaver does not allow both Beaver Race checks to be done at once (unlike Double
  Archery Rewards). Therefore Beaver Race 2 is removed to save runners from repeating the race.
- Snowsanity now exclusively uses the new "Any-Day Snowballs" option when active. This only shuffles snowball
  checks that are available on all three days (still excluding the supply snowballs by the Mountain Village
  and Snowhead owls). This takes the day-specific snowballs in Mountain Village and Twin Islands out of play,
  but spring snowballs are still shuffled. Unlike its predecessor, Any-Day Snowballs is not a hard option.
  Increased base weight (10% -> 15%).
  This change significantly reduces the complexity of the category while trimming its check count
  to 46 from 64, bringing it closer to categories like Keaton Grass and Tokensanity. Snowsanity does have enough
  breadth (7 in spring, 6 in Snowhead, 5 in SHT) to justify a modest weight increase.
- Some overworld-heavy categories have had their total weights adjusted:
  * Keaton Grass: 30% -> 25%
  * Butterfly and Well Fairies: 20% -> 25%
  * Potsanity: 25% -> 20% (taking 5% from the Temples and Side Dungeons option)
  * Bombers' Notebook: 30% -> 20% (taking 10% from the Meetings Only option)
- Other hint changes:
  * Only 2 foolish hints are given (formerly 3).
  * To aid in understanding, the three hint tiers are given official names:
    = "Always" hints are guaranteed to appear on gossips when their check is active.
    = "Minor always" hints are guaranteed to appear when active, but they may be placed on a Garo hint slot.
    = "Sometimes" hints fill out the remaining hint slots. 
  * WotHs, foolishes, and always hints cannot take up more than 12 gossip hint slots. At least 2 gossip hint
    slots will be left open for minor always hints in every seed.
  * Boat Archery is now an always hint instead of a minor always hint.
  * Soilsanity adds Ranch Day 1 Soil as a sometimes hint when active.
  * Small Keys Within Any Temple promotes Ice Arrow Chest to a minor always hint when active.
  * Frogs adds Frog in Woodfall Temple as a sometimes hint when active.
  * Full Potsanity adds Butler Race Dual Pot as a minor always hint when active.
  * When either (or both of) Butterfly and Well Fairies or Potsanity are active, Well Left Path Chest is
    removed from the sometimes hint list.
- Fairy Hunt changes:
  * Starting Boss Remains is no longer rolled or converted to starting Stray Fairies.
  * Boss Keys are off (Doors Open) in all Fairy Hunt seeds. Keysanity: Boss Keys is still not rolled.

Bug fixes
- Prevented Starting Boss Remains from being rolled in Remains Shuffle mode.
- Added Cow Beneath the Well (tier 2 / minor always) when Cowsanity is active.
- Fixed handling of absolute paths for base settings files.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.3
Major changes
- The Fairy Hunt settings file now enables Detect Stray Fairies (shimmering GF Mask).
- The Fairy Hunt settings file now gives no foolish hints (instead of 3).
- In Fairy Hunt seeds, Boss Keys are never shuffled.
- The Mystery Settings document now clarifies that Potsanity's Temples and Side Dungeons setting
  includes Secret Shrine (new full list: Woodfall Temple, Snowhead Temple, Deku Palace, 
  Pirates' Fortress, Ocean Spider House, Beneath the Well, Ikana Castle, and Secret Shrine). 
  This was true in previous seeds, but undocumented.

Script changes
- The script now accounts for the input settings' WotH and Foolish counts when determining how many
  Gossip Stone hint slots are free for extra always hints.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.2
Bug fixes
- Removed Pirates' Fortress Barrel Maze Egg Pot 1 and 2 from Crates and Barrels, as intended.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.1
Major changes
- Updated base settings files for MMR v1.16.0.10 compatibility.
  * For default Mystery and Remains Shuffle, Oath and Boss Remains hints are enabled.
  * For Fairy Hunt, Fairy and Skull hints are enabled.

Mystery Maker / Default Settings release 2.0

Major changes
- Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt settings now are specially supported by the mystery script!
  Giving the script an MMR settings file with all remains shuffled will activate Fairy Hunt mode
  (if Boss Remains Mode is also set to Great Fairy Remains) or Remains Shuffle mode (otherwise)
- Extra base settings files are included for Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt. To make Fairy Hunt
  more race-friendly, special win conditions are in effect.
  * Remains Shuffle matches default settings, except that remains are shuffled.
    Tatl will hint the remains' regions at the start of a cycle.
  * In the Fairy Hunt settings file, all Stray Fairies are shuffled and junked, and all remains are
    shuffled and placed on Great Fairy Rewards. Victory Mode is set to Three Boss Remains and
    Direct To Credits; turning in *three* full sets of fairies wins the game *immediately*!
    The Fairy Fountains will hint the stray fairies' regions.
- Certain categories and weights have been changed. See below for details.

Category changes
- Gossip Fairies is now disabled in default settings (30% -> 0%).
  Gossip Fairies can require major backtracking if Epona's and Healing are found later in the seed;
  delaying gossip visits until then is not viable at all due to gossip hints' importance in Mystery.
  Given that the checks require many extra song plays in any event, and that most gossips are already
  routed in anyway, the category isn't interesting enough to justify the added tedium and play time
  for race-appropriate settings.
- Butterfly Fairies is now Butterfly and Well Fairies. Decreased weight (30% -> 20%).
  The "Well Fairies" are the eight floating fairies in Beneath the Well's left side fairy fountain,
  which requires Blue Potion (and water, and a bug) to reach. Adding these to Butterfly Fairies keeps
  runners from having to blindly visit the well fairy fountain every seed.
  The remaining 1.16 floating fairy checks (in pots and a barrel) could be added in future versions
  should there be both interest from players and a resource to point players to the checks.
- Crates and Barrels no longer shuffles Great Bay Temple Entrance Room Barrel, which has a
  floating fairy.
  This is to make Crates and Barrels consistent with Snowsanity and Potsanity, which don't include
  snowballs/pots that give floating fairies in vanilla.
- The Late Shopsanity option no longer shuffles the Ocean and Canyon Scrub Purchases.
  This halves the chance of the Canyon Scrub's Blue Potion being shuffled (40% -> 20%) which helps
  make left side well access more straightforward on average in the wake of Well Fairies being added.
- Hit Spots now shuffles Swordsman School Gong.
  In West Clock Town, strike the Swordsman School Gong at the top or bottom of any hour (xx:00 or
  xx:30). This is in logic with any transformation mask or the Kokiri Sword.
- When Scoopsanity and Soilsanity are both active, Bottle: Bug is not shuffled.
  Soilsanity requires 15 bugs, one for each check; gathering that many could take prohibitive
  amounts of time if Bottle: Bug is placed on a late or low-quantity scoop like Bottle: Big Poe.
- Scoopsanity now adds Bottle: Big Poe as a tier 2 hint instead of Bottle: Deku Princess.
  Bottle: Deku Princess is checkable (or Blitz-junked) over the course of every seed, whereas
  Bottle: Big Poe's locations are much less regularly visited.
- When Songsanity is not active, Long Quests is less likely to add Baby Zoras (20% -> 10% total) and
  more likely to add Frog Choir (20% -> 30% total).
  Even when enabled, it's uncommon for a long quest to become relevant in a seed, as a required item
  needs to be placed on it. This isn't true of Baby Zoras with Songsanity off, which will very often
  have a required song. Of the other two long quests, Frog Choir is the better candidate to get the
  extra weight in this case, as it's vulnerable to Blitz-junking (very much so if Frogs aren't
  shuffled!)
- Frogs now adds Frog in Great Bay Temple as a tier 2 hint (previously unhinted).
  This is the least accessible of the four frogs and the most inconvenient frog to revisit if
  Don Gero's Mask is found late in a seed.
- The All Notebook Entries option now adds Postman's Freedom as a tier 3 hint (formerly tier 2).
  This ensures that all seeds continue to include all tier 2 hints (even if Cowsanity + Scoopsanity +
  + Frogs + All Notebook Entries are all shuffled!).

Script options
- The script now detects Remains Shuffle and Fairy Hunt settings in base settings files
  and will adjust accordingly.
- Remains Shuffle will be active if the base settings file shuffles all boss remains.
  Remains Shuffle seeds will never give starting boss remains: the Starting Boss Remains category
  is disabled and reaching the hard option maximum will not add an extra remains.
- Fairy Hunt will be active if the base settings file sets Boss Remains Mode to "Great Fairy Rewards".
  When Fairy Hunt is active:
  * All 60 Dungeon Stray Fairies are shuffled and junked.
  * Starting Boss Remains and reaching the hard option maximum give extra starting Stray Fairies
    instead of remains. Blitz will not be set.
    + One starting boss remains becomes three Stray Fairies from each set.
    + Two starting boss remains become five Stray Fairies from each set.
  * The Stray Fairies category is still rolled; when active, it will unjunk the corresponding 
    dungeon Stray Fairies. The Clock Town Stray Fairy is still added as normal.
