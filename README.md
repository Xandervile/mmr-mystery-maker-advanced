This branch is more for the Fairy Quest setting that I am experimenting with as a "more open chaotic fairy hunt", any updates to that will solely go here to not clutter up the main thread. When it is in a "stable" place, I may update the main thread.

Fairy Quest currently differs to Fairy Hunt in the following:
Win Condition: All 60 Stray Fairies, Fade to Victory
Chance to start with Oath: This means that checks on the Moon are shuffled (reasoning: I wanted the seed to be an actual "open world" hunt, and the moon was the final frontier. Having it as a potential shuffle increases the amount of checks but NOT significantly)
Start with All Remains already: Again to allow an open world and to get to the "cleared" state of areas quickly compared to base Fairy Hunt.
